    "# Logistic Regression - Predicting shipwreck survival\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's assignment you will implement a classification algorithm named Logistic Regression. This sounds very counter-intuitive, as regression is something entirely different from classification, but the Logistic Regression model is actually estimating the probability (which is a continuous value) that data can be assigned to a specific class out of a set of classes. We will focus on so-called binary classification problems, wherein there are two possible classes. Some of the examples of binary classification problems that Logistic Regression is able to solve are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Email; spam or not spam \n",
    "- Online transactions; fraud or not fraud\n",
    "- Tumor; malignant or benign \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be using the classic Titanic dataset. This data consists of demographic and traveling information for 891 of the Titanic's passengers, and the goal is to predict which of these passengers survived. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of the data set's attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *PassengerId*: passenger ID assigned in this dataset\n",
    "- *Survived*: a Boolean indicating whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No; 1 = Yes); this is our target\n",
    "- *Pclass*: passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)\n",
    "- *Name*: field containing the name and title of the passenger\n",
    "- *Sex*: male/female\n",
    "- *Age*: age of the passenger in years\n",
    "- *SibSp*: number of siblings/spouses aboard\n",
    "- *Parch*: number of parents/children aboard\n",
    "- *Ticket*: ticket number\n",
    "- *Fare*: passenger fare in British Pounds\n",
    "- *Cabin*: location of the cabin, consisting of a letter indicating the deck, and a cabin number.\n",
    "- *Embarked*: port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can probably see, the dataset contains a mix of textual, continuous, categorical, and boolean variables. Before we can get into implementing and applying Logistic Regression, we will have to clean up the data. We will lead you through this process using functions a data-scientist might use, providing you with the tools that will help you prepare your own data in the future.\n",

    "- The mean of *Survived* indicates that out of the 891 people in our dataset, only ~38% of people survived. This can be deduced from the mean of the column, because the value 1 corresponds to survived and 0 corresponds to did not survive. As an example, when 90% of these values would be 1, we would end up with a mean of 0.9, as the other values are all zeros.\n",

In theory, the model might learn that a passenger with a specific ID is less likely to survive, but that is only relevant to the specific training data used and unlikely to improve predictions for other samples. In order to create a model that will generalize better, we'll completely remove *PassengerId*, *Name* and *Ticket* from this data set.\n",

    "If you did the step above correctly, the `clean_data` DataFrame should now only have 9 columns, as 3 were removed. Looking at this description, we can see there are quite a few missing values in the data set, which are indicated as *null* values. For example, the *Cabin* feature has $204$ non-null values, while the data set consists of $891$ entries, meaning there are $687$ values missing here.\n",

In a more advanced data processing pipeline we might still include some of this data, but that would include data mining techniques that are beyond the scope of this notebook.\n",

In the previous module, you learned about one-hot encoding, which is exactly what we will use here too. Pandas has a method named [`get_dummies`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) that transforms data from categorical to a one-hot encoded set of columns.\n",

However, you could make the argument that it is actually a categorical variable, as it only really has three values. In this case, both interpretations of the variable are valid, as it is a categorical variable with ordinal properties; second class is actually something \"between\" first and third class. Using the variable as if it is numerical, however, *does* imply that the difference between first and second class is the same as the difference between second and third class. Using the variable as if it is categorical implies that there is no order, and that the three different classes have no connection other than that you can only be part of one class."

    "Now that all data is numerical, we can continue to the next step in processing the data. Earlier, we already observed that there is a big difference in the scale of each of the features in the data, which can impact the learning process for a model (see the theory video for more details). Feature scaling can be used to ensure that the different features in your dataset take on similar ranges of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy's `stat` module has some interesting methods to do this, including the `zscore` method which you might also recognise from the theory video:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_j = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_j - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\mathbf{x}_j$ is a vector of x-values for the $j^{th}$ column, $\\mu_j$ and $\\sigma_j$ are the (scalar) mean and standard deviation for that same column, and $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_j$ is the scaled version of the feature vector. The basic principle here is that it transforms every value in the column $j$ to a value that indicates how many standard deviations the value originally was away from the mean of the data *in that column*. For example: a $Z$-score of $-2$ would indicate that the value was 2 standard deviations below the average, while a $Z$-score of $0$ would indicate that the value was actually equal to the mean of the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we transform each of the original numerical data columns using the `zscore` method, by applying it to each of the elements in those columns. The function `zscore` conveniently takes care of computing all means and standard deviations for each column separately, and returns the scaled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we do not want to apply this function to our newly one-hot encoded data, as those are already within a nice $[0,1]$ range and scaling these binary values by their mean and standard deviation wouldn't really make sense here.\n"

    "With the data completely cleaned up, the final step is to put the data into format useful for learning. This means splitting the data into the input features `X` and the target variable `y`. In addition, we'll convert the data to *Numpy* `ndarrays` here, so we can again easily use vectorization in our Logistic Regression implementation. We've used Pandas for reading the data and cleaning it up (which is where *Pandas* excels), and now we'll use *Numpy* for the actual learning / computation portion. Finally, we'll need to also split the data set into a training and test set for learning, for which we'll use the `sklearn` function `train_test_split`."

    "### Assignment 2: The Logistic function\n",
    "\n",
    "For Logistic Regression, we require a function that generates probabilities; a function that gives outputs between 0 and 1 for **all** inputs. There are many functions that meet this description, but the one that is used in logistic regression is the logistic function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `logistic_func` that can either take a single value `z`, or an array of values `z`, and compute the *Logistic* function for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Numpy built-in functions and basic arithmetic operations work on both Numpy arrays and single values. When the function detects that its input is a Numpy array, the operation it applies will be applied to each element in the array separately, the result being a Numpy array of the same shape as the input. This is called *element-wise application*, and many mathematical operations have Numpy versions that support element-wise application. Write your `logistic_func` in such a way that it can compute $g$ values for scalars or for entire vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, write some code that can plot the results for the logistic function between $-5$ and $5$. Use Numpy's [`np.linspace`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html?highlight=linspace#numpy.linspace) to generate a range of $z$ values and use your `logistic_func` to calculate the corresponding $g$ values. Make sure the resulting plot looks correct, before moving on to the next step."

    "### Assignment 3: Building the Logistic model\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can start working on the hypothesis function, which will generate a vector of class probabilities, given some matrix of inputs $X$ and a vector of weights $\\theta$. For logistic regression, we'll use the logistic function $g$ to transform the hypothesis we used in multivariate linear regression into a hypothesis function that only generates probabilities (i.e. results between 0 and 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_\\theta(x^1) = g(\\theta^Tx^1)$$\n",
    "$$ h_\\theta(x^2) = g(\\theta^Tx^2)$$\n",
    "$$ h_\\theta(x^3) = g(\\theta^Tx^3)$$\n",
    "$$\\dots$$\n",
    "$$ h_\\theta(x^n) = g(\\theta^Tx^n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the same hypothesis equation as for multivariate linear regression, just with the logistic function $g$ applied as the final step. *Note:* The notation can be a little confusing here, as $x^i$ is a vector and the default shape for vectors is a *column* vector, even if $x^i$ in the complete data matrix $X$ is a *row* vector. This will actually get somewhat easier when we write out the full vectorized version using the matrix $X$, as the rows and columns get their \"expected\" shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the function $g$ is the Logistic function defined above. As you've just written `logistic_func` specifically to also work on vectors, if we construct a vector of $z$ values for the whole model at once, then we could also write the entire hypothesis function in a vectorized form:\n",

You can also measure the testing or the validation cost at each step and see if this follows the same trend down as the training cost. If the training cost is going down, but your validation cost is going up, then your model must be overfitting.\n",

Finally, the function should return the converged result of the `theta` parameter vector, as before.\n",

But those did not seem like the best fits because the alpha could have been bigger. that makes sense because we ensured that all gradients are less than 1. With gradient values that are so low, we can increase alpha. So i picked alpha = 5 but that diverged / was inaccurate. alpha = 2 looks like a good because the line arrives at convergence the quickest, the slope goes down and slowly flattens out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different thresholds that I picked all were between 10^-4 and 10^-10. The differences were not too big but the steepness of the descent of the lines increases. so I picked 10^-5 because with 10^-4, the line didn't really become flat. 10^-5 does show the convergence.\n",

    "\n",
    "To better understand what relations our model has found in the data we will have to take a look at the weights that our model has learned. The relative size of each weight is a direct indication of how important the corresponding feature is in defining the relationship between the input features and the target output. We can even argue why this is the case, as the hypothesis of our model is entirely dependant on the linear combination of the input values and our weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{\\theta}(x^i) = g(x^i_0 \\theta_0 + x^i_1 \\theta_1 + \\dots + x^i_n \\theta_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function simply \"squashes\" the combined positive values to a maximum of 1, and the combined negative values to a minimum of 0, i.e. a negative weight means that a large value for this feature will actually decrease the chances of survival for a passenger. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input for our function $g$ is composed out of the sums of each input multiplied with its corresponding weight. Since we have made sure that our data all approximately has equal scale by using the `zscore` method, bigger values for a specific weight result in the input corresponding to that weight having more influence on the hypothesis. Similarly, negative values indicate that there is a negative correlation between the input variable and the hypothesis, while positive values indicate a positive correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have used Seaborn to create a barplot that shows each of the weights and their corresponding data column names."

    "## Creating hypotheses for the data\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the 3 features shown above, compare their individual impact on the survival chance of the passenger. For every feature, give your own hypothesis on why this feature is likely to have a positive or negative impact on the survivability of the passenger. Also, add how this then explains the positive or negative weight the feature seems to get in the learned logistic regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Gender of the passenger**\n",
    "\n",
    "*It seems that women are relatively more likely to survive. I suspect that this may be the case because women are given priority during emergencies as \"women and children\" are/were allowed to board emergency boats and get life vests with priority. This explains the positive weight that the gender \"woman\" seems to get: it makes it more likely that teh person will survive. The opposite may be true for the males, which would explain the negative weight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Class of the passenger's cabin**\n",
    "\n",
    "*It seems that class 3 was much less likely to survive, class 1 was slightly more likely to survive and it seems that being in class 2 does not make much difference. The amount of people in class 3 that died is relatively high as a proportion of the total amount of people on the boat. This would explain the negative weight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Age of the passenger**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The data as such does not suggest that the age of the passenger makes much of a difference. Or at least, i'd say that age is not (on its own) a reliable indicator with just the bars above. This could have many causes. For example, particularly vulnerable individuals such as children and the elderly may have not survived and their influence on the mean could cancel each other out. So tye mean would not give an accurate picture of reality. Alternatively, age may not have been a relevant factor at all, but I doubt that since age can be linked to many other factors.  So i'd say that age may be linked to another factor like gender or class. For example, older people can be expected to have more money are more likely to fare in class 1 or 2. (e.g. older men were more likely to survive, but young men were less likely). And you could factor gender into this as well. This could explain the negative weight, as whatever the age is linked to such as class and/or gender such as male, would decrease the odds of survival.*\n"
